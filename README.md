### What is Crypto Against Humanity?
Crypto Against Humanity is a never ending game of Cards Against Humanity, where all participants compete to find the best matches. Crypto-economic primitives incentivize and reward card creation and curation. Users submit black cards to a Token Curated Registry and create white cards that each have an associated bonding curve market. Players participate by buying into the white cards that match best with the black card in the current round. One black card is chosen at random for the round every 12 hours. Players can make money by selling a white card they bought into early, or by creating black cards that the community deems valuable!

### How Can I Play?
We are still building Crypto Against Humanity, but you can test it out at CryptoAgainstHumanity.io! We are currently running it on the Ropsten test network, but plan to launch on mainnet as soon as possible!
